# IOT-BASICS-
 This repository contains the code and documentation from my internship, where I worked with an "ESP32-based IoT sensor module kit"to learn and implement various IoT concepts using multiple sensors and actuators.
 # Project Overview :
During the internship, I developed and tested multiple mini-projects using the ESP32 DevKit:

# 1. LED LIGHTING:
- LED blinking program with adjustable delay timing.
- Learned GPIO output control on the ESP32.

# 2. RELAYPROGRAM:
- Relay control using ESP32.
- Demonstrated switching of external devices via relay module.

# 3. SWITCHREAD:
- Reading input from a physical switch/button.
- Learned how to handle digital inputs and trigger actions.

# 4. ULTRASONIC SENSOR:
- Ultrasonic distance measurement using **HC-SR04** sensor.
- Distance displayed in centimeters and inches via serial monitor.

# 5. WIFIBLYNK:
- Connected ESP32 to **Blynk IoT platform** over Wi-Fi.
- Remote control and monitoring using the Blynk mobile app.

# Hardware Used:
- ESP32 DevKit
- LED Module
- DHT11/DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Relay Module
- Push Button Switch
- Piezo Buzzer

# Software & Tools:
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Board Library
- Blynk IoT Platform
- C / C++ for Embedded Programming
